## Test Data
The synthetic datasets in this directory are autogenerated and not based on any real-world data. They are provided solely for testing purposes under the MIT License.

I'm still writing the tests in detail, so for now I suppose manually running tests could work if you're contributing to the project:

```bash
python run.py --file_path data/file_to_test.csv --file_type csv --use_llm --save_report --visualize
```
